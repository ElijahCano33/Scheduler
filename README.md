## App Description :boom:
Scheduler is a mobile scheduling calendar service application that facilitates the process of creating and keeping track of both your own events as well as your friends'. Users can either just manage their own events or if they have some friends they can search for them within the app, add them, and begin viewing or marking their calendar with activities for both of them to do together!
